LOST AND FOUND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Have you lost an item but dread having to take an arduous pilgrimage across the campus in search of the Lost & Found?
Have you seen an item and wanted to help someone find it faster? The Lost & Found Management System does just that!

Users can report a lost item to add the item to the database (list).
Users may also try and request an item if it is lost. 
When they do so, they must include/answer a short form:

Item Name: What is the item?

Last Location: Where was the item last seen?

Last Time Seen: When was the item last seen?

They must then drop said item to the LOST & FOUND section(s) of the school.
We suggest workers centralizing the LOST & FOUND.


An item can be marked LOST or FOUND. When an item is LOST, it is displayed in the LOST section of the form. Otherwise, when it is FOUND, it is displayed in the FOUND section of the form.

When LOST/FOUND is communicated, it is displayed that someone retrieved the object
